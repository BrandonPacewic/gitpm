# :open_file_folder: Git Project Manager

A cross platform tool for managing a large number of git projects from the command line.

## Features

- Track git projects:
  - gitpm has the ability to keep track of all repositories on your machine, this allows it to present you with the status and stats of all of your local projects and keep them up to date.
- Enhanced `git status`:
  - Want a status command that actually checks if your branch is behind the current head? Well now you can. You can also check up on all of your tracked repositories at the same time.
- Start using it at your own pase:
  - gitpm has the ability to grab all of the git repositories on your computer, but you don't need to do that if you don't want to. Track one repository at a time and see how it goes. Note that the true power of gitpm comes from using it for a massive amount of projects.

## Install

Currently to install gitpm it is required that you clone the repository on your local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/BrandonPacewic/gitpm.git
python3 -m pip install gitpm/
```
